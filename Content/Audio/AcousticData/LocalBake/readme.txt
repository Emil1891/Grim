Baking acoustics on a local PC is an option that many customers utilize when scene sizes are small and getting familiar with the technology is the goal. As scene sizes increase, using a service like Azure Batch will reduce the time it takes to complete a bake.

After creating a local bake directory via the Prepare Local Bake button, select the Download Local Bake Tools button to download the bake tools package and place the tools in the chosen local bake directory.

Once the tools and the configuration files are co-located in the local bake directory, execute the "RunLocalBake.bat" script to start a bake that will run serially on your local PC producing a new working directory matching the starting timestamp of the bake. To import the .ace file into your project, use the Content Browser to navigate to the Content"Acoustics folder and either drag and drop your .ace file into the folder -or- select the Import button and find the .ace file you would like to import into the project. Once the import is complete, you can then set the Acoustics Data property of the AcousticsSpace actor to new .ace file. Consult the documentation on https://aka.ms/acoustics for more documentation about importing ACE files into a project.
